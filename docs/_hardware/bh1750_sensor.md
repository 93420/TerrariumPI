## Information

The BH1750 is a light intensity sensor that can be used to adjust the brightness
of display in mobiles and LCD displays. It can also be used to turn the
headlights of cars on/off based on the outdoor lighting. The sensor uses I2C
communication protocol so that makes it super easy to use with micro
controllers. The SCL and SDA pins are for I2C.

There is no calculation needed to measure the LUX value because the sensor
directly gives the lux value. Actually, it measures the intensity according to
the amount of light hitting on it. It operates on voltage range of 2.4V-3.6V and
consumes really small current of 0.12mA. The results of the sensor does not
depends upon the light source used and the influence of IR radiation is very
less. There are very less chances of any error because the variation in
measurement is as low as +/-20%.
