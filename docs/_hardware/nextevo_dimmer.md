## Information

A MAINS Power Dimmer/Switch with integrated Phase detection and ZCD (Zero
Crossing Detection) processing. It is Triac driven and intended to be used for
lighting control. Tested and working ok with standard lightbulb (incandescent
lamps or the new Halogen ECO). For LED or fluorescent lights you need to check
first that they are dimmable units.

Designed and tested for EU MAINS 240V/50Hz but working also OK on US 110/60hz.
