With this I2C multiplexer you can add multiple I2C buses that can hold multiple
sensors and or relays. This makes it also possible to use multiple sensors with
the same I2C address, but connecting them to different buses.

In order to use this multiplexer, you have to connect it to the first I2C bus,
which is normally [GPIO pin 3 and 5](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/i2c#) and then
add an extra config line to `/boot/config.txt`. Put the following line below the
line: `dtparam=i2c_arm=on`:

`dtoverlay=i2c-mux,pca9548,addr=0x70` (addr defaults to 0x70 so can be omitted
if using that address).

After rebooting, you should have up to 8 new I2C devices at the location:
`/dev/i2c-*`.
[You can then use the I2C address as normal but you need to add the I2C bus](/TerrariumPI/hardware/#i2c-bus).

This should work for **pca9542** (2 channel), **pca9545** (4 channel), and
**pca9548** (8 channel) devices.
