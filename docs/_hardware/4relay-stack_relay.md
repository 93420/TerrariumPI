## Information

Drive 8A/240VAC loads and read 3V to 240V, AC or DC, opto-isolated inputs for
all your Home or Industrial Automation Projects

Perfect add-on to your project when you have to control large number of heavy
duty AC loads and/or you have to read wide range inputs. Stackable to 8 layers,
the card can add up to 32 relays to each Raspberry Pi in a very compact form
factor. In addition, you can read up to 32 opto-isolated inputs.

Pluggable connectors make the 4-RELAYS card easy to use when multiple cards are
stacked up. All relays have Normal Open and Normal Close contacts and can switch
up to 8A/240VAC.

The optically isolated universal inputs can read AC or DC signals from 3V to
48V. The input connectors have a low voltage port which can read signals between
3V and 24V, and a high voltage port which can read signals between 24V and 48V.
