## Information

The LED-Warrior18 is a LED driver with I2C interface and two separate channels
that can be controlled independently. Due to the I2C interface it can be
controlled with all common I2C hosts (e.g. Arduino, ESP32 or Raspberry Pi). The
power supply of the LED-Warrior18 is done via the I2C interface. The output side
can be operated with a voltage between 5.5 and 40V DC and max. 4A per channel.

The LED-Warrior18 can be equipped with screw terminals on the output side as
well as with a 1x4 pin header for the I2C interface (screw terminals and pin
header not included).

All further information about the product can be found on the
[product page](https://codemercs.com/en/led-lighting/driver-with-i2c-interface).
Software and sample programs for the LED-Warrior18 can be downloaded from our
[Github repository](https://github.com/codemercs-com/lw18).
