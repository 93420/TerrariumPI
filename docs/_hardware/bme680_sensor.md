## Information

The BME680 is the first gas sensor that integrates high-linearity and
high-accuracy gas, pressure, humidity and temperature sensors. It is especially
developed for mobile applications and wearables where size and low power
consumption are critical requirements. The BME680 guarantees - depending on the
specific operating mode - optimized consumption, long-term stability and high
EMC robustness. In order to measure air quality for personal wellbeing the gas
sensor within the BME680 can detect a broad range of gases such as volatile
organic compounds (VOC).
