## Information

The CCS811 Air Quality Breakout is a digital gas sensor solution and comes with
an I2C interface that senses a wide range of Total Volatile Organic Compounds
(TVOCs), including equivalent carbon dioxide (eCO2) and metal oxide (MOX)
levels. VOCs are often categorized as pollutants and/or sensory irritants and
can come from a variety of sources like construction materials (paint, carpet,
etc.), machines (copiers, processors, etc.), and even people (breathing,
smoking, etc.).

The sensor offers simple and easy interface through I2C. Libraries, circuit and
sample codes are available for Arduino, Raspberry pi, ESP32, etc.

This breakout is intended for indoor air quality monitoring in personal devices
such as watches and phones. The CCS811 is an ultra-low-power digital gas sensor
that integrates a CCS801-bit sensor and MCU with an analog-to-digital converter
(ADC ) to detect indoor air quality.
