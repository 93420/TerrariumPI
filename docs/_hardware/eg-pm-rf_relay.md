## Information

This is a bundle of the Energenie Pi-Mote and our 4-way RF extension lead. With
the simple Python script available to download on this page you can control each
socket individually or all together with your Raspberry Pi. This is perfect for
controlling sockets in hard to reach places.See the GPIO Zero documentation for
example usage:
