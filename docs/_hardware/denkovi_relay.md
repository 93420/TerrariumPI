## Installation

**This is already included in the Docker image.**

As the license of Denkovi does not allow to ship their command line tool with my software. Therefore you have to download and install it manually.

Make sure you have Java installed:

```console
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless
```

### Download

Download the Denkovi Command line tool from: [https://denkovi.com/denkovi-relay-command-line-tool](https://denkovi.com/denkovi-relay-command-line-tool) and unpack it into the directory `3rdparty/DenkoviRelayCommandLineTool/`.
Then either rename the jar file to DenkoviRelayCommandLineTool.jar or make a symlink to it.

The software expects the following file to exists: `3rdparty/DenkoviRelayCommandLineTool/DenkoviRelayCommandLineTool.jar` from the root TerrariumPI directory.

#### Docker

For docker please put the jar file in the Docker volume `/TerrariumPI/3rdparty/DenkoviRelayCommandLineTool`. Depending on your setup look in your [docker-compose.yaml]({% link _tabs/install.md %}#docker) file. Here also make sure the file is called `DenkoviRelayCommandLineTool.jar` inside the volume.
