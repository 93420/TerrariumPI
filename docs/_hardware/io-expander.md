With the IO expander pcf8574 and pcf8575 you can add more GPIO [relays](/TerrariumPI/hardware/#relays) and [buttons](/TerrariumPI/hardware/#buttons) to TerrariumPI. This IO expander does only support on/off actions. So it is not possible to use this IO expander with a DHT sensor. You cannot read out the extra GPIO ports.

## Addressing

In order to use this IO expander, enter the following address in the GPIO relay or button address field.\
`pcf857<4/5>-<IO expander port>,<I2C Address>,[I2C Bus number]`

Either use pcf857**4** or pcf857**5** to select the used IO expander.

`<IO expander port>` is mandatory and is a number from 1 till max ports.

`<I2C Address>` is mandatory and specified [here](/TerrariumPI/hardware/#i2c-bus).

## PCF8574

This is a 8 ports IO expander. The yellow on the image.

## PCF8575

This is a 16 ports IO expander. The right blue board on the image.
