## Information

The ExplorIR®-W is a small footprint low power CO₂ sensor designed for
applications where space is at a premium. The combination of small size, low
power and high accuracy makes this sensor suitable for portable, battery powered
personal safety equipment.

The ExplorIR®-W has a very wide dynamic range and is capable of measuring CO₂
gas concentrations up to 100%, without compromising measurement accuracy or
responsiveness.

The ExplorIR®-W uses patented NDIR solid-state LED optical technology that
delivers consistent and accurate CO₂ measurement performance over the lifetime
of the sensor.
