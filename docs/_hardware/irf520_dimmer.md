## Information

This little module is a breakout board for the IFR520 MOSFET transistor. The
module is designed to switch heavy DC loads from a single digital pin of your
micro-controller. Its main purpose is to provide a low cost way to drive a DC
motor for robotics applications, but the module can be used to control most high
current DC loads. Screw terminals are provided to interface to your load and
external power source. An LED indicator provides a visual indication of when
your load is being switched.
