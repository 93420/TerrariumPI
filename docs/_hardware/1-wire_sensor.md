## Information

Using the 1-Wire bus is an easy way to add multiple sensors. This can be temperature or humidity sensors. During the startup of TerrariumPI all the sensors that are connected to the 1-Wire bus will be auto detected.

The 1-Wire bus is enabled by the installer and therefore, it will work out of the box. Use physical pin 7 (GPIO 4) for the data wire.

### DS18B20

An easy to use temperature sensor is the [DS18B20 sensor](https://components101.com/sensors/ds18b20-temperature-sensor) Make sure you use a 4.7K resistor when connecting 1 or more DS18B20 sensors.
