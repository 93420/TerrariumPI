## Information

The SHT3x-DIS has increased intelligence, reliability and improved accuracy
specifications compared to its predecessor. Its functionality includes enhanced
signal processing, two distinctive and user selectable I2C addresses and
communication speeds of up to 1 MHz. The DFN package has a footprint of 2.5 x
2.5 mm2 while keeping a height of 0.9 mm.

This allows for integration of the SHT3x-DIS into a great variety of
applications.

### Features

- Fully calibrated, linearized, and temperature compensated digital output
- Wide supply voltage range, from 2.4 V to 5.5 V
- I2C Interface with communication speeds up to 1 MHz and two user selectable
  addresses
