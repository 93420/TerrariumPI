## Information

EG-PM2-LAN / EG-PMS2-WLAN is a power outlet strip with advanced power management features. It is possible to individually switch 4 sockets on or off manually via your local network or Internet, by timer schedule, or by programmable special events (eg: switch on my scanner whenever I start Photoshop, or have my printer switched on only when I really print). With your free personal user account on EnerGenie.com you can manage your EG-PM2-LAN via Internet from all over the world, even with your smartphone.
