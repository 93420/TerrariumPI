## Information

The AMG8833 is a 64-pixel temperature sensor developed by Panasonic under the
Grid-EYE® product line. The sensor contains an 8x8 array of infrared
thermopiles, which approximate the temperature by measuring the infrared
radiation being emitted from emissive bodies. The Grid-EYE communicates via the
I2C bus, which also makes it compatible with Raspberry Pi and Arduino right out
of the box.

The AMG8833 contains an onboard lens that limits the viewing angle of the sensor
to 60-degrees, which results in a sensing region useful for objects in the
mid-field (as opposed to far-field or near-field). It also operates at 3.3V and
5V, at a sample rate of 1Hz-10Hz, with an approximate temperature resolution of
0.25°C over a range of 0°C to 80°C.

The AMG8833 is useful for applications in thermal imaging, heat transfer
analyses, human temperature monitoring, heating and air condition management,
industrial control, and other applications in non-contact temperature
measurement.
