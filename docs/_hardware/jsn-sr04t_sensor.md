## Information

This water proof ultrasonic sensor has good performance with almost the same
usage as the HC-S04 module.

Features

- Small size, easy to use
- Low voltage, low power consumption
- High accuracy
- Strong anti-jamming
- Integrated with wire enclosed waterproof probe, suitable for wet, harsh
  measurement environments
