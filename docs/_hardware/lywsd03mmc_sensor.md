**Warning:** Sometimes firmwares can be updated by the manufacturer via the app, which may cause this device to not communicate with TerrariumPI anymore. TerrariumPI doesn't need any app setup for this device, it will work out of the box.

Some command line tools support more detailed features for this sensor like configuring the zones for the emoticon, changing display temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and other more complex interactions.

This is sometimes advertised as a "Mija" or a "Mi Temp" device, but the page will usually mention "LYWSD03MMC" specifically if it's one of these.
