## Information

MLX90614 sensor is manufactured by Melexis Microelectronics Integrated system,
it has two devices embedded in it, one is the infrared thermopile detector
(sensing unit) and the other is a signal conditioning DSP device (computational
unit). It works based on Stefan-Boltzmann law which states that all objects
emits IR energy and the intensity of this energy will be directly proportional
to the temperature of that object. The sensing unit in the sensor measures how
much IR energy is emitted by a targeted object and the computational unit
converts it into temperature value using a 17-bit in-built ADC and outputs the
data through I2C communication protocol. The sensor measures both the object
temperature and ambient temperature to calibrate the object temperature value.
The features of MLX90614 sensor is given below, for more details refer the
MLX90614 data-sheet.
