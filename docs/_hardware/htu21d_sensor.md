## Information

The HTU21D is a low-cost, easy to use, highly accurate, digital humidity and
temperature sensor. This sensor is ideal for environmental sensing and data
logging and perfect for a weather stations or humidor control systems. All you
need is two lines for I2C communication and you’ll have relative humidity
readings and very accurate temperature readings as a bonus!

There are only four pins that need to be hooked up in order to start using this
sensor in a project. One for VCC, one for GND, and two data lines for I2C
communication. This breakout board has built in 4.7k pull up resistors for I2C
communications. If you’re hooking up multiple I2C devices on the same bus, you
may want to disable these resistors.

Note: Full drops of water can damage the sensor. We recommend wrapping the board
in Teflon/irrigation tape for extreme conditions where water droplets may find
their way onto the sensor.
