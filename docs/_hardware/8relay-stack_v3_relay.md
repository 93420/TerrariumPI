## Information

Perfect add-on to your project when you have to control large number of loads.
Stackable to 8 layers, the card can add up to 64 relays to each Raspberry Pi in
a compact form factor.

Pluggable connectors make the 8-RELAYS card easy to use when multiple cards are
stacked up. All relays have NO and NC contacts and can switch 120VAC/8A or
24VDC/8A.

Status LEDs conveniently grouped on one side of the board show when relays are
on or off. A power LED shows when power is applied. A reset switch permits
shutting down the Raspberry Pi without the use of a keyboard and monitor.
