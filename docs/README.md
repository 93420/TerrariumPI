# Update documentation

In order to update or add new documentation you need to have Jekyll installed.
Then fork this repository and checkout the `4.x.y.z` branch. From that, make a
new branch to make your changes. Then create a pull request for the `4.x.y.z`
branch. When the pull request is finished, a new version of the documentation
will be created at https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI

This can be done on a normal computer/laptop. The documentation does not need a
running TerrariumPI.

The documentation is created using Jekyll. This is a framework for generating a
static website. The pages consists of HTML or Markdown content. More information
about Jekyll can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

## Install Jekyll

Go to https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ and follow the installation
instructions.

Then go to the root folder of TerrariumPI and run: `bundle install`. This will
install all the needed plugins and template for generating the documentation.

## Run local version

After Jekyll is installed, go to the `docs` folder and run the command
`jekyll serve` to open the website at: http://localhost:4000/TerrariumPI/

### Bug

Somehow auto reloading does not work, It produces an error. So you have to
manually stop and start again to see the changes.
