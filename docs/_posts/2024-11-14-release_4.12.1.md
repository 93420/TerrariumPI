## Release 4.12.1 - Webcam enhancements

![Webcam icon](/assets/img/webcam.svg){: .right width="200" } In this release we
added some new webcam features and fixes. The 'big' update is that we now can
clear the webcam archive so that the SD card will not get 100% full. A full SD
will crash TerrariumPI. If you want to set this up, make sure you manually clear
first the majority of the files. Else the first delete action can take a long
time and make TerrariumPI crash.

So now you can give an amount of days of archive to keep. Or just keep
everything by leaving the value empty.

Also we found that the webcam notification where broken. They are now fixed. Now
it should send out messages with pictures when you setup webcam notifications.

And we improved the motion detection of live streams a bit. In the past the
change in time could trigger a motion, where you can end up with an image every
update of 30 seconds. So now we exclude the area where the name and time is
shown. And that will not trigger a motion anymore.
