## Release 4.11.1 - Maintenance update

With this update we fix some small issues and updated all external libraries.

Updated the Docker builds to make them a bit faster and smaller in size.

Added some extra warnings at the documentation pages for the
[DHTXX]({% link _hardware/dht11_sensor.md %}) sensors.

A new portuguese translation is added by
[MakoShark2](https://github.com/MakoShark2) and other languages are updated.

### Fixes

Fixed a bug that when you are already logged in, the log lines did not show up
fully in the log screen.
[#939](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues/939)

Removed all direct `gevent` functions. So it can also run without Gevent when
needed in the future. Using
[monkey patch](https://www.gevent.org/api/gevent.monkey.html), we still use
Gevent.
