## Release 4.10.1 - Another Docker fix release

This release is again for Docker users only. Somehow the Docker health check is working differently, and that was killing the container before the software could start. So the health check is changed, and should wait for a maximum of three minutes to startup before restarting the container when unhealthy.

And for the Bullseye Docker image, there was an OS package missing which made not to start up. This has also been fixed.
