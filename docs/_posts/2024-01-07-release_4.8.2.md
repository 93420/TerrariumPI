## Release 4.8.2 - First release in 2024

The first release in 2024 is here. With this release we have added a new bluetooth controllable relay. This is the [Voltcraft SEM6000]({% link _hardware/voltcraft-sem6000_relay.md %}). Which is pretty small and easy to use.

Futhermore there are some code fixes for Telegram and we have added a GUI build patch.

**Important**: In this update we have moved some 3rd party libraries to PIP libraries. Make sure you rerun the installer!
