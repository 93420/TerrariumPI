## Release 4.8.3 - New hardware, security fixes and Telegram updates

This upgrade will add some more Telegram support and updates. We do support a new relay which is the TAPO P100. Updated documentation about upgrading TerrariumPI and some maintenance updates. Also we have tighten the encryption a bit.

### Telegram updates

![Telegram icon](/assets/img/telegram-logo.webp){: .right width="100" }It is now possible to let the Telegram bot reconnect to existing chats when TerrariumPI is restarted. So you will keep receiving notification messages through Telegram after a restart of TerrariumPI of the Raspberry PI itself.

### New hardware

![TAPO P100 relay](/assets/img/Tapo-P100_EU.webp){: .right width="100" }We do now support [TAPO P100]({% link _hardware/tapo_p100_relay.md %}) and P105 wifi sockets. They need a somewhat special address to get them work. Thanks for [@RobinM-MB](https://github.com/RobinM-MB) for testing.

### Security updates

We have updated some part the code to store more data encrypted in the database. The weather url holds an API id. That was not encrypted in the database. Now when you add or update your [weather settings]({% link _tabs/setup.md %}#weather), the url will be stored encrypted in the database, and therefore your API id can not be read out of the database directly anymore.

And the code for encrypting and decrypting has been refactored to one location. So it is easier to apply and secure more data.

### Documentation updates

Added the needed upgrade steps for [upgrading TerrariumPI]({% link _tabs/install.md %}#upgrading). A bit stupid that it took that long to add it to the documentation. :grin:

There are some documentation updates done. For the [VEML6075 sensor]({% link _hardware/veml6075_sensor.md %}) we added an extra warning that this sensor is not working correctly with UVB lights. It turns out, this sensor needs IR light as well to operate. And that is not transmitted by a UVB light.

Added some more old new posts of websites that promoting TerrariumPI. And added [Stuarts]({% link _posts/2019-01-04-tutorials-by-stuart.md %}) attempt to make a full tutorial setting up TerrariumPI.

Also it is now possible to leave reactions under news posts. So if you like this new release post, leave a reaction below. It needs a Github account and uses [giscus](https://giscus.app/). Try it out :point_down: :point_down: :point_down:

### Maintenance

The installer is updated a bit. Now you will get a message when TerrariumPI will install the software, and no more questions are needed. So you can leave it running and do something else in the meantime.

We updated to the latest NodeJS libraries and migrated some libraries from Github to npm versions. This should make updates a bit easier. The GUI itself should not be changed. Only a bit faster... :wink:

Calendar fixes. It can happen that not all dates in the calendar has a time zone configured. This could crash the calendar loading. This is now fixed.

Updated some python submodules to their latest version. And made a code patch for the Voltcraft python library. The patch will be applied during installation of TerrariumPI.

Updated some copyright years. Nine years already. :grinning:
