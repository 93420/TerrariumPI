## Release 4.4.0

This is release witch contains new hardware, code improvements and hopefully a
bit speed improvement. Also there are translation updates and we have a new
language Catalan.
[Get the new version here](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.4.0).

Here are some highlights of this release.

## I2C Multiplexer

TerrariumPI is tested with an [I2C
multiplexer]({% link _hardware/i2c-multiplexer.md %}) in order to add more I2C
buses to the Raspberry PI and the ability to add fixed address sensors/relays on
different buses. And this support is just in the Raspberry PI OS. Just connect
it to the first I2C bus and add a single line to the file `/boot/config`. [More
can be found here]({% link _hardware/i2c-multiplexer.md %}).

## Hardware

There is now support for 2 new dimmers. The first dimmer is the [I2C 4 channel
LED AC dimmer]({% link _hardware/i2c-4ch_dimmer.md %}). This is a dimmer that
can control up to 4 electrical devices.

The other dimmer is the
[LED-Warrior18]({% link _hardware/led-warrior18_dimmer.md %}) dimmer. This is a
DC dimmer that can control 2 electrical devices.

And we should be able to support majority of the [AtlasScientific
sensors]({% link _hardware/atlasscientific_sensor.md %}).

## Bug fixes

The following bugs are fixed:

- A nasty time table bug when using the climate mirror mode. This mostly happens
  when the difference in timezones was around 10-12 hours.
- Fixed BrightPI support.
- Try to improve the overall speed. It looks it is a bit faster, but it is also
  depending on the used hardware and Raspberry Pi version.
