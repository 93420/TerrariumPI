## Release 4.9.1 - Fine tuning

### Fine tuning total power and water usage

![High voltage Logo](/assets/img/high-voltage.webp){: .right width="150" }The [previous release]({% link _posts/2024-05-11-release_4.9.0.md %}) did improve the speed a lot with caching the total power and water usage. This saves a lot of CPU time with a big database.

But this also had a downside. The actual power usage is not updated while the relays toggles. So that has now be fine tuned. The actual power and water usage will updated first, before the big total power and water usage query is run.

So now the GUI will reflect more actual the power and water usage when a relay changes state.

### Docker changes

![Docker Logo](/assets/img/DockerLogo.webp){: .left width="150" }With this release, there are more Docker changes.

For backwards compatibility the `:latest` tag is referring to the image with OS `buster` and with Java `-java`. As that was always the default.

#### Bookworm

Bookworm builds are added, but not fully tested. As it takes a lot of time to test all images on a Raspberry PI. So still a bit at own risk. But at least it should start.

Raspberry PI 5 **not** supported! This is due to different hardware design.

#### Split up Java vs Non Java

![Java Logo](/assets/img/java.webp){: .right width="150" }The next big thing is that the images are split up with or without Java. This is done in oder to reduce the size of the images. So if you need Java you should use the `4.9.1-[OS]-java` tag in your docker compose file. If you do not need Java, leave the `-java` out of the image name.

Both `-java` and non java images are the same. The only difference is the presence of Java. You need a Java image when you want to use [Denkovi V2]({% link _hardware/denkovi_relay.md %}) relays.

The non Java version is **50MB smaller** to download.

### Small updates

Reverted back the MQTT library. As the new version does work with a small change, other libraries depending on it, do not. So that bug was already fixed. But now it is finally fixed.

Fix graph exports on the dashboard.

Updated the smoothing code for graphs. The alarm values are now also smoothed. So that should produce even nicer graphs.

And fixed the documentation page. Somehow that was broken since the last release.

And updated all external libraries to the latest version.
