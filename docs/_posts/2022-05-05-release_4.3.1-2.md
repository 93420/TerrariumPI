## Release 4.3.1 and 4.3.2

The release 4.3.1 is a small update which will fix some small bugs and updates some libraries. This will also add the SHT3XD sensor as a new sensor. It appears this sensor works a bit different than all the other SHTXX sensors.

And there is a nasty bug fixed with the pca9685 dimmer when running in Docker.

In release 4.3.2 we fixed a FFMPEG issue. This was a result of missing OS libraries, and this will need to update your [docker-compose.yaml]({% link _tabs/install.md %}#docker) file. The path `/opt/vc/bin` is changed to `/opt/vc` so we can also use the `lib` folder which is needed for FFMPEG.

This release has a lot of small fixes. Also this release will support more hardware. [Get the new version here](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.3.2).

Here are some highlights of this release.

## GUI

The GUI is updated with the latest [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/) template. And we have reduced the amount of plugins. All plugins that are not used are now removed from the source, resulting a lower size in Docker and on disk.

Also the [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) is updated.

## Hardware

We now support [SHT3XD]({% link _hardware/sht3xd_sensor.md %}) sensor.
