## Release 4.10.0 - Make GPIO relays work like they should

### GPIO relay changes

![GPIO relays](/assets/img/GPIO_Relay_small.webp){: .right width="150" }In this release we have changed the [GPIO relay]({% link _hardware/gpio_relay.md %}) code. So if you use those relays, pay attention to the following.

Due to a historical code bug, the GPIO relays where for most people working in **reverse order**. And this made it also a bit difficult to support the IO expanders. So the code has now be simplified.

TerrariumPI will make a GPIO pin **HIGH** when the relay should be toggled on. This is the basic default of most GPIO relay code, so we follow this logic. And it this is somehow not working for your GPIO relays, you can now use the `calibration` part at the GPIO relay, to put it in `inverse` mode. \
This means also that the GPIO inverse relay type is gone. We have not just 1 GPIO relay hardware type.

When you have upgraded TerrariumPI and start it up again, it will convert your GPIO Inverse relays to normal GPIO relays, and the normal GPIO relays will be put in **reverse** mode. This should swap the GPIO inverse logic, and should make the relays still work like normal. \
If this is not the case, you can just edit the GPIO relay, and toggle the **inverse** option in the `calibration` part.

### IO Expanders

Whe dropped support for the pcf8575 (16 channel) device. As the the overall IO expander code was a bit buggy, we are now using a different library. But that library does not support the pcf8575 chip. So we have dropped support for that.

You can always stack multiple [pcf8574 expanders]({% link _hardware/io-expander.md %}) together to get 16 extra GPIO ports.

### Upgrading
