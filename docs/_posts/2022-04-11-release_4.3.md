## Release 4.3.0

This release has a lot of small fixes. Also this release will support more
hardware.
[Get the new version here](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.3.0).

Here are some highlights of this release.

## IO Expander

There is now support for two [IO expander
boards]({% link _hardware/io-expander.md %}). This way, you could add more
buttons and GPIO relays though I2C bus. This expander boards can only toggle
ports on or off. It is **not** possible to use it for sensors.

## Area updates

There were some bugs in the area setting of an enclosure. Those are fixed and
there is a new feature. You can now ignore alarm values per area if needed. So
for the low alarm tab, you can now ignore the low alarm, and only use the high
alarm value for toggling relays.

Also there is a better check for depending areas. So when the area you depend on
turns in an alarm state, it will also shutdown the area that depends on it.

## Hardware

We now support [SHT4X]({% link _hardware/sht4x_sensor.md %}) and
[BME680]({% link _hardware/bme680_sensor.md %}) sensors and
[RTSP]({% link _hardware/rtspcam_webcam.md %}) based webcams.

Also we support hardware PWM again like the old legacy way in TP3.

So, go the [installation]({% link _tabs/install.md %}) page in order to install
Terrarium PI version.
