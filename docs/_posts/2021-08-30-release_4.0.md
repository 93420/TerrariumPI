## Release 4.0.0

After more then a year there is a new version. It took so much time as it is
almost a complete rewrite. That was not planned, but it did happen.

The idea was to create a better REST API so that it would be easier to
integrate. Unfortunately that did not succeed, so we have lost about 6 months
testing and creating all kinds of code. So for now, the API is changed, but the
documentation is not. So that did not succeed.

But the biggest improvement is that we now can support multiple enclosures with
multiple areas. So that means that you do not need a Raspberry PI per enclosure
anymore. And that you can have now two or three heating area's with their own
configuration. And the timing for the lights is updated and more clear how to
setup.

So, go the [installation]({% link _tabs/install.md %}) page in order to install
Terrarium PI version.
