## Release 4.8.4 - Ancient bug fix

### Settle time bug

![Homer Simpsons: DOH!](/assets/img/doh.webp){: .right width="150" }Apparently there was a bug in the code for many, many years :disappointed:. The settle time value was calculated from the time the relay was toggled on. But when the relay on duration is higher than the settle time value, the settle time was useless.

So, the time **on** is 5 minutes, and the settle time is set to 4 minutes, it will never settle. Which is totally wrong.

The settle time now starts when the relays is toggled **off**. And it does not matter if the relay is toggled of manually of by timer/sensor. This is how it should work from the beginning. Thanks to [@manolof](https://github.com/manolof) for finding this.

This also updated the relay toggling logging and logic to improve relay toggling in certain situations.

### Bluetooth changes

![Bluetooth logo](/assets/img/Bluetooth.svg){: .right width="100" }The [MiFlora]({% link _hardware/miflora_sensor.md %}) sensors are now logging the current battery state in the log file. Now you can see at least in the log if your MiFlora sensor is getting low on power.

Also the bluetooth scanning messages are more clear.

For Bookworm OS, a new bluepy module is needed. This module could be not 100% compatible with the old bluepy module. At this time, it is at own risk.

### GUI updates

A big thanks to [@manolof](https://github.com/manolof) for updating the gui so that it will render better on a mobile device. Apparently he is a better frontend developer than me :wink:

And the sort order of enclosures and areas is changed. Now it can sort based on number when the names are starting with numbers. So then it will sort 1..4-10 etc. This applies to enclosers and areas. With one exception. For area sorting, the [main light area]({% link _tabs/setup.md %}#main-lights) is always shown first. As this can control the other areas below.

### Bookworm adaptation

With this update, The installer should be able to install on Bookworm. But it has not been tested. So it is at own risk. Bugs can be reported, but no guaranty that they can/will be fixed at this time.

### Maintenance updates

Docker fixes and updates.

Updated Python and NodeJS libraries.

Fixed deleting displays in the notification system.
