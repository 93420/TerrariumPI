## Release 4.12.0 - Just a new release

This new release is not a big release. It has some bugfixes and logging
improvements. One new improvement is that we now support Sonoff D1 Dimmer in DIY
mode.

### Sonoff D1 Dimmer DIY mode

Now it is possible to use the [Sonoff
D1 Dimmer]({% link _hardware/sonoff_d1_dimmer.md %}) in DIY mode. This makes it
easier to add this dimmer to TerrariumPI. A big thanks to
[MakoShark2](https://github.com/MakoShark2) for testing and helping with
creating the code.

### Improvements

Improved the light timer calculation when TerrariumPI is restarted after
midnight, before the end of the current light period. Thanks to
[rossisbudda](https://github.com/rossisbudda) for finding this
[bug](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues/948).

The logging has been improved to log now the correct hardware names. Due to a
bug, not the correct hardware name was shown in the log.

### Translations

The [Spanish language](https://weblate.theyosh.nl/projects/terrariumpi/-/es/) is
updated by [nebu73](https://github.com/nebu73).

### Bug fixes

Fixed the logging in the TerrariumPI GUI when you where already logged in. There
was an issue with correctly reading the authentication cookie.

Fixed a cookie saving issue due to deprecated code in the
[Bottle.py](https://bottlepy.org/) web server code.

Fixed installation on Bookworm OS. It was missing a SSL library. That has been
fixed.

### Documentation updates

Updated the [Sonoff D1 Dimmer]({% link _hardware/sonoff_d1_dimmer.md %})
documentation about support for DIY mode.

Updated the backup, restoring and debug [FAQ]({% link _tabs/faq.md %}).
