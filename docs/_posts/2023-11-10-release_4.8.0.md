## Release 4.8.0 - Return of the Telegram

![Telegram icon](/assets/img/telegram-logo.webp){: .right width="150" }A new
release with a big new feature. There is support for Telegram in the
[notification]({% link _tabs/notifications.md %}#telegram) system. It took some
time to implement because I do not use it. So lucky there was
[@cmonicob](https://github.com/cmonicob), which made a nice start and did all
the testing to make it work. A big thank you!! I only optimized some code.

But there is more. In the old 3.X version you could only receive messages. Now,
you can even send command to get some realtime information from TerrariumPI. So
you can now just ask for the latest webcam picture through Telegram. How cool is
that!!

[Get the new version here](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.8.0).

Or, go the [installation]({% link _tabs/install.md %}) page in order to install
Terrarium PI version.

### Notification toggle

And a new feature is that you can now enable or disable notification messages
per [button](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues/842), relay or
sensor. So now you can just send out updates of a single relay or sensor. For
existing buttons, relays or sensors they are by default enabled.

### Updates

There is an option to invert a button. This is possible for all button types.
You can find it at the 'calibration' part of the button form.

Updated the code that detects
[on which hardware it runs](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/pull/841).
Apparently it can run on other devices than a Raspberry PI.

#### GUI updates

The web gui has been updated to the latest libraries. Also the
[auto dark mode has been updated](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues/852)
to have some more options. You can set in the [settings page]({% link _tabs/setup.md %}#settings).

And there is a new option on the settings page called 'limit graph values'. When
this toggle is enabled, the graphs will limit the measured values to 20% of the
limit min and max value. This will eliminate some spiky graphs. The setting is
working for all sensor graphs.

#### Documentation updates

The documentation website has been update with the latest
[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) template. And added
some new [FAQ pages]({% link _faq/reset_webgui.md %}) and updated some other pages.

### Bugfixes

There were some errors with the forms for adding and updating hardware and
areas. This is now all solved

Fixed the option that shows the
[all sensors](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues/845) menu option.

Fixed the check if the software is running in Docker.

Fixed Kasa hardware support.

Fixed external python script support. Now you can use all the installed
libraries from TerrariumPI.

Not all sensitive fields where encrypted that are used in the notification
services. This has been updated. To be sure your data is encrypted, you can edit
the notification services and just save them. That should encrypt the data.
