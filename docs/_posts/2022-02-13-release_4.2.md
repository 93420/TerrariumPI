## Release 4.2.0

This release has a lot of small fixes and the main goal was to speedup the
software. Also this release will support more hardware.
[Get the new version here](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.2.0).

Here are some highlights of this release.

## Speed improvements

With this release the GUI now supports compressed javascript and css files.
During the installation the .gz files are created and the webserver will serve
the gzipped files when the browser asked for a compressed file. This should save
about 40% of bandwidth during the loading of the GUI.

Also there are some changed in the code so there is less database usage, which
should also make the GUI a bit more responsive.

## New hardware

In this release we also have some new hardware that we support. This is a new
bluetooth sensor called [LYWSD03MMC]({% link _hardware/lywsd03mmc_sensor.md %})
which is a look a like of the MiTemp sensors. Thanks to
