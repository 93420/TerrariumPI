## Release 4.1.0

A new release after just for the end of the year. So this is the Christmas
release! With this release we have a lot of new features, new hardware support
and some bugfixes.
[Get the new version here](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.1.0).

Here are some highlights of this release.

## Climate mirroring

![Earth Globe](/assets/img/Globe.webp){: .right width="100" } It is now possible
to mirror temperature and humidity from a given weather location. This will
means that the temperatures will be changed during the day based on the previous
day on the selected location. And if you have dimmers running some heaters, they
will increase and decrease nicely during the day.

This is all based on the selected weather location in the weather settings.
Using the `variation` tab on an area, you can select weather as a variation
source.

## Area sensor variations

Like the climate mirroring it is also possible to change the sensor values
according to a specified schema. So if you want to have a certain temperatures
at 10:00, at 14:00 and 20:00, you can now set this up in the `variation` tab.

## Area dependencies

Another big feature is the ability to let area depending on each other. This
way, you can prevent a sprayer system to run dry if the water tank is getting
low on volume. If you select the water tank as depending area in the
sprayer/humidity area, the sprayer will only operate when it needs based on the
selected rules, **and** when the depending water tank has no alarm. As soon the
water tank is on low volume, and the alarm is shown, the sprayer will not
operate anymore.

This can be done with almost any area. Disable water heaters when the water tank
is empty is now also possible.

## Docker support

![Docker Logo](/assets/img/DockerLogo.webp){: .right width="100" } Also with
this new version, there is
[docker support](https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/install/#docker). This
should make it easier to upgrade and install the software. As this is still new,
it could be that there are some bugs. If you found one,
[please report](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues). Thanks to
[@alec-pinson](https://github.com/alec-pinson)!

This also means that you can run TerrariumPI on a newer Debian (Bullseye).
Natively you still need Debian buster.

## New hardware

In this release we also have some new hardware that we support. Those are the
[Qwiic Relay]({% link _hardware/qwiic-relay.md %}) and [newer relay cards of
Sequent Microsystems]({% link _hardware/8relay-stack_v4.md %})

So, go the [installation]({% link _tabs/install.md %}) page in order to install
Terrarium PI version.
