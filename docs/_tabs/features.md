Here are some features that TerrariumPI has.

## Local weather and climate mirroring

Using local weather data, you can use sunrise and sunset as timers for your
lights or other relays. This way you get automatically seasons following the
season outside. [More...]({% link _tabs/setup.md %}#weather)

It is also possible to mirror the temperature and humidity of the weather at the
given location. This can be set on every temperature or humidity controlled
area. And per area you can even select an offset, so you can create shade area
and a full sun area based on the same climate. Look at the variation tab to set
this up.

But you can even enter an external JSON source for climate mirroring. Look [How
to use remote data FAQ]({% link _faq/remote_data.md %}) how to add the correct
url.

## Multilingual

The software is translated to multiple languages. This will also select the
correct currency, number and date formatting. If you language is not available
or is not complete, go to the [translation
page]({% link _tabs/translations.md %}) to see how to update it.

## Multiple enclosures and multi areas

It is possible to control multiple enclosures with a single Raspberry PI. As
long you can hook up enough sensors and relays, you can create unlimited
enclosures and areas.

In every enclosure you can create multiple areas, even of the same type, to
setup your enclosure. So you can create a sun spot area and a shading spot area
that have their own settings and logic in the same enclosure.

## Costs indication

Based on the entered power and water usage per relay and with the power and
water price in the settings page, we can make an estimate of the running costs
of your terrarium. Keep in mind this is an estimate, and does not handle big
price fluctuations.

## Data encryption

Some data is sensitive like the authentication password or the cloud
credentials. This data is stored encrypted in the TerrariumPI database. That
means when you database is lost, your passwords will not be compromised
directly.

There is a difference in how the data is encrypted.

### Admin password

The admin password is encrypted one way in a hash, and that hash is checked with
the entered login credentials. This password cannot be reverted back to plain
text if you loose it. [But you can reset
it]({% link _faq/reset_authentication.md %})

For encryption we use [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt).

### Other sensitive data

Cloud credentials are stored with symmetric encryption. This means that the data
can be reverted back to plain text. This is needed to able to login to the cloud
providers. TerrariumPI is logging as 'you'.

For encryption we use
[Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/#using-passwords-with-fernet)
encryption with the CPU serial as salt. As every CPU has it's own serial, the
salt is unique and locked to your Raspberry PI.

## Docker

You can also install a Docker image to make the installation easier. More
information can be found at [installation
page]({% link _tabs/install.md %}#docker)
