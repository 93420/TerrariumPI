When you want to delete a sensor/relay/button that has been used for more than 3
months, you should use the manual/debug way to delete the sensor through the
GUI. This is due to the time it takes to delete the data from the Sqlite
database. If this takes more then 2 minutes, the systemd watchdog will restart
TerrariumPI and the delete will not succeed.

In order to not have the problem of the 2 minutes watchdog timeout, you have to
run TerrariumPI in debug mode. You can [stop
TerrariumPI]({% link _faq/systemd.md %}#stop) as follows.

When running in [debug mode]({% link _faq/debug.md %}), you can just go the
sensor/relay/button and delete it. Now it does not matter how much time it
takes. Just wait until done.

If the deleting is done, stop the debug version of TerrariumPI and [start
normally]({% link _faq/systemd.md %}#start).
